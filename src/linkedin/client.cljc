(ns linkedin.client
  "LinkedIn Posts API — portable `.cljc`.

  I/O is injected (`:http-fn` / `:json-write` / `:json-read` / `:creds`), the
  same DI shape as `kotoba-lang/com-x` and `kotoba-lang/com-youtube`.

  ## Three headers that are not optional

  LinkedIn's REST surface is versioned per-request, not per-URL:

    LinkedIn-Version: YYYYMM        pins the API version
    X-Restli-Protocol-Version: 2.0.0
    Authorization: Bearer ...

  Omitting either of the first two gets a 426 or a 400 that reads like an auth
  problem, so `headers` always sends them and `:linkedin-version` is a required
  credential rather than a default this library silently picks — a client that
  chooses the version for you breaks on LinkedIn's schedule, not yours.

  ## The post id is in a header

  `POST /rest/posts` returns 201 with an empty body; the URN is in the
  `x-restli-id` response header. Reading the body gets you nothing and looks
  like a silent failure."
